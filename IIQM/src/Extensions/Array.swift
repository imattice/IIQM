    //- Originally, I thought it would be neccessary to use a method to remove the q1 and q3.  I first used a mutating method, but it didn't read as well as I had hoped, and it was a bit clumsy to use.  I then opted for a method that just returned another array, but while optimizing, I found that creating so many arrays (both in sorting and in returning an array) that this was causing significant slowdown.  This function is not particularly useful to Array<Int> anyway, so I moved this functionality to the interquartileMean function and just removed this extra step
    
//    ///Removes the highest and lowest 25% of values
//    func medianQuartileValues() -> [Double] {
//        let lowerIndex = Int(count*1/4)
//        let upperIndex = Int(count*3/4)
//
//        return Array(self.sorted()[lowerIndex...upperIndex])
//    }

    
//    ///Removes the highest and lowest 25% of values
//    mutating func removeInterquartileBounds() {
//        self.sort()
//        let lowerIndex = Int(count*1/4)
//        let upperIndex = Int(count*3/4)
//
//        self = Array(self[lowerIndex...upperIndex])
//    }
