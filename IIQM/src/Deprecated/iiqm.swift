//REFACTORING
//PROBLEM: IIQM lacks readability and clairity.
//1) The name IIQM does not convey what the class is used for.  We can either get rid of it, or rename it.
//2) The two functions contained are a bit unrelated and don't necessarily need to be grouped together in the same class.
//3) The calculate:path method is very difficult to understand.  Variables are excessive and poorly named, there are no comments or descriptions, and it relies on the readFile:path method, which I don't think is necessary.

//SOLUTIONS:
//1) Move the calculate:path method to an Array<Int> extension.  This will allow us to act on the data directly, which will improve readability as well as give this functionality to any Array<Int> in the app without having to call a custom class.
//2) Create a class that is designated for reading the text file.  That is a unique behavior that should be in its own class.  This also leaves open the potential to expand it if in the future we need to read other files.
//3) Use proper naming conventions and add definitions to all classes, methods, and properties so that it is clear what they are used for.
//4) Both the Array<Int> extension and the TextReader class can be easily tested.  We can develop these using TDD.
//5) Deprecate the old IIQM class so that future developers do not use it. This also sets it up to be permanently removed in the future
