//        //look for pattern in quartiles as new numbers are added

//        [2, 3, 5, 9, 9]
//        q1 = 2.5, q2=5, q3 = 9
//        Note: the count is odd and the new value is in the median quartile, so the q1 & q3 do not change
//        //add 4
//        [2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 9]
//        q1 = 3, q2=4.5, q3 = 9
//        Note: the value is between q1 and q2, so those are recalculated.  q3 stays the same
//        add 6

//        q1 = 3, q2=5, q3 = 9

//        add 6

//        //the points at which the values stay the same don't seem reliable with such a small data set

        
//        //only recalculate on the odd count?
//        //this would be kind of difficult to understand without a lot of payoff.  When we get to the millions of values, the median will still be too large to calculate quickly

//        [1, 5.5, 7, 10]
//        [1, 6.25, 10]
//        //the values are lost over time.  This would likely be fast and also trend accurate over time, but if we are looking for exact, testable matches, this wouldn't be a good approach
